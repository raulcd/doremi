# DOREMI

Test app to say do speech to text recognition for musical notes.

Following the tutorial on [realpython](https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/)

## Issues found

No matter the language is set to spanish, `do` gets recognised as `dog`.
Some sounds like `fa` seem to extend the mic capture for a really long time, should look into close capture after some time.
